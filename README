# RstoxData version: 1.0.10 (latest alpha, 2020-09-08)
# R version: 3.6

# Tools to fetch and manipulate various data formats for fisheries (mainly geared towards biotic and acoustic data).

# The RstoxData package contains functions for reading, filtering and writing biotic, acoustic and landing data as XML files. Filtering can be done by R syntax such as longitude > 10, or by pre defined functions such as inside(). On computers that return errors when trying to run the Rtools through RStudio (most institutional Windows machines), install the binary directly from https://github.com/StoXProject/RstoxData/releases. Download the newest RstoxData zip file, click the "Packages" tab -> "Install" -> "Install from:" "Package Archive File" -> "Install". If the installer does not complain, the package is installed correctly.
