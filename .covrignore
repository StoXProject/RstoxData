# Some code has been copied into the repository from other sources for practical reasons, 
# and because their licence allows
# In development we have been treating these similarly to external dependencies 
# like other R-packages and c-libraries
# As long as we do not touch these files, 
# we will continue to treat them like that and exclude it from our testing-coverage reports, 
# the same way we do not report testing of formal dependencies like other R-packages.
# Files that we have found the need to alter, will be removed from this ignore-file.
# For this reason src/xmlfile.cpp, src/readXml.cpp and src/readXmlStream.cpp are not listed below
